# Computer-Networks-Mini-Projects
A collection of several small networking projects

## Description of each project/exercise:
Project 1 - Provides experience with ISP networks architecture, design, and Internet traffic pattern

Project 2 - Provides experience with ISP’s major functional areas and network QoS/QoE

Project 3 - Provides experience with network security topics – confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, symmetric/asymmetric cryptosystem, and post-quantum cryptography.

Project 4 - Mininet network simulators, design a Software-Defined Networks (SDN)-based architecture, set its parameters, and simulate various scenarios.

Project 5 - Mininet network simulators, design a Software-Defined Networks (SDN)-based architecture, set its parameters, and simulate various scenarios. Conduct multiple experiments to evaluate QoS metrics such as latency, packet loss, jitter, and bandwidth.

Project 6 - Provides experience with network security principles, architecture, protocols, standards, and the best practices.
